    <h2>Name: Jurdan Escobedo</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Jurds</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, Jurdan here, you can call me "Jurds". I'm happy to be part of this WDD130 class.  Excited  to read your profiles or introductions too.</p>
    <p>Im Married with four children, my eldest is a boy and followed by three girls. My wife is a stay-at-home mom.</p>
    <p>My hobbies are Ham radio, watching movies, and tinkering eletronics or Networking devices including iot devices.</p>
    <p>I started BYUI, first attempt to get a certificate way back in 2018 after graduating from BYU PATHWAY. Back then I am fulltime employed as IT Systems Administrator in a BPO company here in the Pampanga Philippines, and as the company grows, new technology acquired, I have to learn more things, and so, I stopped enrolling on the third semester of my fist cource CIT. But recently just this June, I got layed-of from work, and decided to continue studying, but this time I chose to get a degree in software development.</p>
    <p>I started self-studying programming before, but I think that is not enough for me to get hired as a professional programmer, so I decided to get a formal education. I'm hoping that after finishing this course I'll have the experience and credentials to land a programing job. </p>
    <p>As for church membership, I am a convert since August 1999. I served a fulltime mission last January 2001 - January 2003, Temple married in december 2003</p>
